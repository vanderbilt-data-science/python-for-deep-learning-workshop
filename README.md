# python-ds-worshop
> A repository for learning data analysis using pandas

This repo contains the notebooks for the Python Basics and Python for Data Science workshops.  Please see `01.00-Workshop-Overview.ipynb` for more details.  All notebooks have solutions provided.  If you fall behind during class or get lost, please feel free to use these solutions notebooks to catch up or determine the correct behavior of your code.  Otherwise, try to code along with the instructor and try the exercises on your own!

Please feel free to stop us during the session to ask questions.  Breakout rooms will be provided in case errors are encountered; however, switching to the solutions until a break or coding exercise is recommended so that you don't fall behind on content.
