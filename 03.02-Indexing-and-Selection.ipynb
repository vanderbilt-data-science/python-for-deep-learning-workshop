    "\n",
    "As of version 0.13 (released January 2014), Pandas includes some experimental tools that allow you to directly access C-speed operations without costly allocation of intermediate arrays.\n",
    "These are the ``eval()`` and ``query()`` functions, which rely on the [Numexpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) package.\n",
    "In this notebook we will walk through their use and give some rules-of-thumb about when you might think about using them.\n",
    "\n",
